# Dependencies

## X

The usual array of X libraries:

 - libxi
 - libxinerama
 - libxft
 - libxfixes
 - libxtst
 - libx11

## Wayland (sway/wlroots only (**no gnome support**))

 - libwayland-client
 - cairo
 - xkbcommon

*Note:* The wayland port has several limitations due
to the nature of Wayland's architecture.

See the LIMITATIONS section of the man page for more details.

## MacOS:

 - The standard Xcode command line developer tools.

# Installation

Make sure you have the appropriate dependencies for your system:

E.g

## debian/ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install \
	libxi-dev \
	libxinerama-dev \
	libxft-dev \
	libxfixes-dev \
	libxtst-dev \
	libx11-dev \
	libcairo2-dev \
	libxkbcommon-dev \
	libwayland-dev &&
make && sudo make install
```

By default warpd will build a single binary for both X and wayland. An X or
Wayland only binary can be generated by setting either `DISABLE_WAYLAND` or
`DISABLE_X` at compile time.

## macos:

```
curl -L https://github.com/rvaiya/warpd/releases/download/v1.3.5/warpd-1.3.5-osx.tar.gz |  sudo tar xzvfC - / && launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.warpd.warpd.plist
```

or (from source)

```
# Install the xcode command line tools if you
# don't already have them.
xcode-select --install

make && sudo make install && launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.warpd.warpd.plist
```

*Note:* On initialization you may be prompted to add the warpd binary to your
accessibility settings. **If you are upgrading it may also be necessary to run
`sudo tccutil reset Accessibility` (this will remove all applications
from your accessibility settings)**. The service is now also managed by a
launchd service (see below) and should not be explicitly started by the
user.

*Note 2:* Some programs (e.g iTerm) have a 'secure input mode' that may need to be
disabled in order for warpd to work properly.

Changes to `~/.config/warpd/config` can be effected by restart the system service using launchctl:

E.g

```
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/com.warpd.warpd
```

The service can be disabled with

```
launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.warpd.warpd.plist
```

# Quickstart

1. Run `warpd`

## Hint Mode
2. Press `A-M-x` (`alt+meta+x`) to generate a list of hints
3. Enter the key sequence associated with the desired target to warp the pointer to that location and enter normal mode.
4. Use the normal mode movement keys to select the final desination (see Normal Mode).

## Grid Mode
2. Press `A-M-g` (meta is the command key) to activate the warping process.
3. Use `u`,`i`,`j`,`k` to repeatedly navigate to different quadrants.
4. Press `m` to left click, `,` to middle click or `.` to right click.
5. See Normal Mode

## Normal Mode
2. Press `A-M-c` to activate normal mode.
3. Use the normal movement keys (default `hjkl`) to adjust the cursor.
4. Press `m` to left click, `,` to middle click or `.` to right click.
5. Press `escape` to quit.

In order to use a square cursor instead of your system cursor, set the `virtual_cursor` option.

A drag movement can be simulated from any of the above modes by focusing on the
source and then pressing the `drag_key` (default `v`) which will cause normal
mode to be activated for selection of the drag target.

A more comprehensive description can be found in the [man page](warpd.1.md) (along with a list of options).

## Wayland

*Note:* Wayland does not permit clients to globally bind hotkeys. These must be
bound within the compositor using warpd's oneshot flags.

E.g

On sway:

```
bindsym Mod4+Mod1+x exec warpd --hint
bindsym Mod4+Mod1+c exec warpd --normal
bindsym Mod4+Mod1+g exec warpd --grid
```

# Packages:

`warpd` is currently available on the following distributions:

## Arch

Available as an [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/warpd-git/) package (maintained by Matheus Fillipe).

If you are interesting in adding warpd to your distribution's repository please contact me.

# Limitations/Bugs

- Programs which use Xinput and or Xtest for keyboard may not work correctly
  (e.g synergy). If a specific program which you feel should be working does
  not please file an [issue](https://github.com/rvaiya/warpd/issues).

- The hack used for pointer hiding on OSX doesn't work on some programs (e.g
  iTerm). The original cursor will consequently be visible in such cases,
  though functionality should be otherwise unaffected.

- Wayland support has several limitations (see CAVEATS in the man page).
